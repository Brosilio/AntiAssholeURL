# AntiAssholeURL
I'm fucking fed up with the 19 gigabytes of tracking bullshit that dumb fuck idiot webdevs put in their dumb ass bullshit websites. I go to copy the fucking URL of some eBay page or some bullshit, and when I paste it into Discord or whatever, the url fills up like 6 pages of text or is too long to send in a message. I've coined the term "asshurl" (combination of asshole and URL) to describe these "asshole URLs," because these URLs are something you'd hurl out of your asshole.

Real-world example of an asshurl:

![asshurl example](https://i.imgur.com/K2rB4oR.png)

the url in that example is about 1.1kb. holy. fuck. that's not even the worst I've seen, but it's the worst recent example I had.

on top of that, the retard webdevs make it literally fucking impossible to find the "Share this page" button. like, what the fuck. it's faster to manually trim the url by deleting the tracking bullshit than it is to scour the page for the share button and then menu-dive through the 600 billion apps it can copy to. Who the FUCK fucking *emails* URLs anymore? why the fuck is that even an option? FUCK!

This software runs in the background on Windows and detects when you copy an asshurl to your clipboard and unfucks it immediately so that you don't look like a dumbass when you try to share a URL and end up shitting out a whole ass goddamn chapter book instead.

### Known issues
This currently only works for websites that have easily distinguishable URLs, such as "ebay.com/itm/0000". Piece of shit cock sucker websites, like Scamazon, prefer to throw common sense up their own assholes and use the most bullshit urls like "amazon.com/huge-cock-extensions/dp/00000". this makes it more of a pain in the ass to parse out the proper data without accidentally destroying the important content. I'll probably rehaul it later, but for now, eBay is the only website that's enough of an incel prick to feed you 2kb urls - which is why it's the only officially supported site for now.
