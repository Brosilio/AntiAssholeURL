# AntiAssholeURL
I'm fucking fed up with the 19 gigabytes of tracking bullshit that dumb fuck idiot webdevs put in their dumb ass bullshit websites. I go to copy the fucking URL of some eBay page or some bullshit, and when I paste it into Discord or whatever, the url fills up like 6 pages of text or is too long to send in a message. I've coined the term "asshurl" (combination of asshole and URL) to describe these "asshole URLs," because these URLs are something you'd hurl out of your asshole.

Real-world example of an asshurl:

![asshurl example](https://i.imgur.com/K2rB4oR.png)

the url in that example is about 1.1kb. holy. fuck. that's not even the worst I've seen, but it's the worst recent example I had.

This software runs in the background on Windows and detects when you copy an asshurl to your clipboard and unfucks it immediately so that you don't look like a dumbass when you try to share a URL and end up shitting out a whole ass goddamn chapter book instead.
